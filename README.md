## Rapid Skill Acquisition Project

## Overview

This project was conceptualized the solve the problem of information overload in pursuit of learning
new technical skills.

With millions of tutorials, blogs and sites offering their own perspectives, methods and courses, it can
be confusing to know how to reach the end goal you set out to reach.

Before long, this overwhelm results in complete withdrawal or a state of paralysis.


## Goals

This project will contain a list of curated skills.

For each skill, the user will be able to see the shortest to their desired skillset.

Each step will outline the specific technology or skill that needs to be learned and the amount of 
hours it will take.

Additionally, users will be able to complete specific tasks needed to acquire the skill and mark it as completed.
Once the learning portion has been completed, the user will be presented with a test to move on to the next step.

## Implementation

Mainly, this project will rely of graph algorithms to search for the fastest path.

## Technology Stack
1. React
2. Material UI
3. Firebase

## Current Status
1. Front end design has been completed.
2. Graph algorithms have been implemented.
2. Data for one skill has been added.
3. The project displays shortest path and number of hours for one skill.

## Future Developments
1. Complete the remaining 3 skills that are displayed in the skills dropdown.
2. Add tasks under each step (to be completed by the user if they choose to)
3. Provide resources to the user if they choose to use other platforms to learn a certain topic.
